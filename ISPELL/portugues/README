# Some annotations:
#
# The affix file uses both upper- and lower-case affix flags, so you
# must              #define MASKBITS 64 in your local.h file.
#
# 8 bits used (latin1) (please remove the #define NO8BIT line)
#
#
#    available modes:
#        -T lat               (latin1)
#     #   -T tex
#     #   -T pre               (  'a 'e ,c ...)
